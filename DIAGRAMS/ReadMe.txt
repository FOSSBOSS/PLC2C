Here are some testing Files. 
There have been several methods in use with this project, 
including logical gate structures, frequency analysis, and structural analysis project files.
Gate structures are basic logical operators such as NOT, NOR, AND, OR, XOR, NAND. 
The purpose of Logical gate structures is to provide logical operations for later analysis in high level laguage conversions.

The purpose of Frequency analysis diagrams is to to provide a systematic means of seraching for unique data structures in the project files.

The purpose of structural diagrams are to figure out how the ladder diagrams are coded in vertical, and horozontal space, and to determine how rungs and rails 
are represented. These are not operational diagrams, but are to give hints on how the ladder diagrams are coded in dimensional space.
