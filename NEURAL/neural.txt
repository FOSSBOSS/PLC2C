The purpose of this section is to develope the novel approach of using AI to deduce local operatios, based on image, and document processing. 
This section has not been widely developed yet, as I have some concerns that even with correctly, interpreted logical structures, and diagrams, 
there would be challenges in verfying the functionality, if a means of testing and verification was not previously generated. 


Producing repeatable, accurate diagrams, and circuits is part of the goal for the greater PLC2C project.  Additionaly, while some of the data in PLC logic diagrams is visual,
there are many segments not immediately visuble, such as configuration data, extended memory, internal functions, and specifications, such as model and devices. 


The general plan at the moment is to figure out how to collect the hidden data from project files, and then use an AI / Neural Network to determine logical operations.
Possibly processing the daigrams visualy, and verifying operations using a form of string, or binary analysis.
