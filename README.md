This is a project to explore various PLC programing softwares, in an effort to create a means of producing 
C source code from Ladder diagrams. One component is the simple logic processing of ladder diagrams. Another component
is reading existing project files and performing a conversion to C, or other high level languages. 
Then there is the component where, using structured language, Indunstry standard project files can be created.

Every PLC manufacturer peforms PLC programing via different interfaces, control commands, and data structures.
I would like to try to fix some of this. 

The goal of plc2c is to write a command line program that reads PLC project source code, and produces a high level programming language such as C as output.  

Extended goals are to create a C source file as input, then produce PLC project files. 

Current status of this project is analysis, and method development. I wanted to link a repo in some offical docuemtnation, so I created this repo.
