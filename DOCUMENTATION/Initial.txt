findings so far:
Heres a short list of basic component byte codes:
0B 04 = vertical line
0D 04 = rungs
F8 03 = horozontal lines

E9 03 = Normaly Closed contact
EA 03 = Normaly Open contact
EB 03 = Output coil
EC 03 = Output not
EF 03 = Set coil
F0 03 = Reset coil

10 bytes seperate each device. 
{ speculating }
the 10 bytes seperating various devices, seems to follow a pattern of 
byte separator, start position, byte seperation, center, byte seperator, end position,byte separator.

I'll try to verify this soon. I think Ill have to write a very long ladder diagram to figure out how many bytes are positional, vs seperational. 

Then also: N-bytes per rung:
I think this is a constant: ( 2 bytes per segment * 9 segments) + 10 bytes per seperator * 8 byte seperated positions = 98 bytes per rung. 
I can verify that simply enough. 

Then to write a logic translator by parsing for the first rung.
