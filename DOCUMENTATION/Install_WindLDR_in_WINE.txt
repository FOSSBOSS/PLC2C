Installing WindLDR in wine, or crossover:
before making your bottle, install cups, cups-pdf before making the WindLDR bottle \n
make sure cups is running, else WindLDR isn't smart enough to find a virtual printer. \n
WindLDR is the only component of the suite with this issue.

$ln-s /var/spool/cups-pdf/$USER ~/.cxoffice/[YOUR_BOTTLE]/dosdevices/c:

this takes care of the inability to print.



sudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
sudo apt install winetricks
$ winetricks corefonts
$ winetricks allfonts

how to use wintricks in crossover:

sudo apt install libusb-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev 
sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata

add user to plugdev if not previously there:
$sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER

Write a udev rule:
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb.rules 
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", MODE=0666

Save file, reload udev rules:
$sudo udevadm control --reload-rules


## WHY 99-rules file? NN-device-rules, NN sets priority, 99 is a low priority.
